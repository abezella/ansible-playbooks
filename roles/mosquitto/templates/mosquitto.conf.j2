# General configuration
# =================================================================

# Time in seconds to wait before resending an outgoing QoS=1 or 
# QoS=2 message.
#retry_interval 20

# Time in seconds between updates of the $SYS tree.
#sys_interval 10

# When run as root, drop privileges to this user and its primary 
# group.
# Leave blank to stay as root, but this is not recommended.
# If run as a non-root user, this setting has no effect.
# Note that on Windows this has no effect and so mosquitto should 
# be started by the user you wish it to run as.
#user mosquitto

# The maximum number of QoS 1 and 2 messages currently inflight per 
# client.
# This includes messages that are partway through handshakes and 
# those that are being retried. Defaults to 10. Set to 0 for no 
# maximum. Setting to 1 will guarantee in-order delivery of QoS 1 
# and 2 messages.
#max_inflight_messages 10

# The maximum number of QoS 1 and 2 messages to hold in a queue 
# above those that are currently in-flight.  Defaults to 100. Set 
# to 0 for no maximum (not recommended).
#max_queued_messages 100

# =================================================================
# Default listener
# =================================================================

# IP address/hostname to bind the default listener to. If not
# given, the default listener will not be bound to a specific 
# address and so will be accessible to all network interfaces.
# bind_address ip-address/host name
#bind_address

# Port to use for the default listener.
#port 1883

# The maximum number of client connections to allow. This is 
# a per listener setting.
# Default is -1, which means unlimited connections.
# Note that other process limits mean that unlimited connections 
# are not really possible. Typically the default maximum number of 
# connections possible is around 1024.
#max_connections -1

# =================================================================
# Persistence
# =================================================================

# If persistence is enabled, save the in-memory database to disk 
# every autosave_interval seconds. If set to 0, the persistence 
# database will only be written when mosquitto exits.
# Note that writing of the persistence database can be forced by 
# sending mosquitto a SIGUSR1 signal.
#autosave_interval 1800

# Save persistent message data to disk (true/false).
# This saves information about all messages, including 
# subscriptions, currently in-flight messages and retained 
# messages.
# retained_persistence is a synonym for this option.
persistence true

# The filename to use for the persistent database, not including 
# the path.
persistence_file {{mqtt_conf.persistence_file}}

# Location for persistent database. Must include trailing /
# Default is an empty string (current directory).
# Set to /var/lib/mosquitto/ if running as a proper service.
persistence_location {{mqtt_conf.persistence_location}}

# =================================================================
# Logging
# =================================================================

# Places to log to. Use multiple log_dest lines for multiple 
# logging destinations.
# Possible destinations are: stdout stderr syslog topic
# stdout and stderr log to the console on the named output.
# syslog uses the userspace syslog facility which usually ends up 
# in /var/log/messages or similar.
# topic logs to the broker topic '$SYS/broker/log/<severity>', 
# where severity is one of D, E, W, N, I which are debug, error, 
# warning, notice and information.
# Use "log_dest none" if you wish to disable logging.
{% for dest in mqtt_conf.log_dest %}
log_dest {{dest}}
{% endfor %}

# Types of messages to log. Use multiple log_type lines for logging
# multiple types of messages.
# Possible types are: debug, error, warning, notice, information, 
# none.
# Note that debug type messages are for decoding the incoming 
# network packets.
# They are not logged in syslog.
{% for type in mqtt_conf.log_type %}
log_type {{type}}
{% endfor %}

# =================================================================
# Security
# =================================================================

# If set, only clients that have a matching prefix on their 
# clientid will be allowed to connect to the broker. By default, 
# all clients may connect.
# For example, setting "secure-" here would mean a client "secure-
# client" could connect but another with clientid "mqtt" couldn't.
#clientid_prefixes

# Boolean value that determines whether clients that connect 
# without providing a username are allowed to connect. If set to 
# false then a password file should be created (see the 
# password_file option) to control authenticated client access. 
# Defaults to true.
