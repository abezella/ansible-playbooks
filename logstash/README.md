logstash
========

This will install, start, and manage a [logstash][] service on a host.  It
will require the elasticsearch playbook.  This is still a work in
progress.  *It has not been tested*.  Among other things, it needs the
[tanuki service wrapper][] so that the service can be properly managed.
